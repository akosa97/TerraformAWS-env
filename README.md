# TerraformAWS-environment
creates a secure AWS environment with VPC, subnets, security groups, and an IAM role that a developer can use to deploy EC2 instances

# Prerequisites
Terraform Installation: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download and install Terraform by following the instructions in the official Terraform documentation: Terraform Installation Guide.

AWS Account: Ensure you have an active AWS account. If you don't have an AWS account, you can create one by visiting the AWS website: AWS Account Creation.

AWS Access Key and Secret Key: Obtain your AWS access keys (access key ID and secret access key) with the necessary permissions to provision resources. If you don't have access keys, follow the steps outlined in the AWS documentation to create and configure them: AWS Access Keys Guide.

IAM Permissions: Make sure your IAM credentials associated with the AWS access keys have the required permissions.

Configuration Customization: Customize the Terraform code to suit your requirements. For example, update VPC CIDR blocks, availability zones, or security group rules based on your preferences. Refer to the code comments for guidance.

Backend Configuration: If you intend to use a remote backend for Terraform state storage, configure it accordingly. Follow the Terraform documentation to set up the backend using AWS S3 or any other supported backend of your choice.

Deployment Steps: To deploy the Terraform code, follow these steps:

Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform project.
Execute terraform plan to review the execution plan and ensure everything looks correct.
Run terraform apply to create the AWS environment based on the Terraform code.
If desired, you can use terraform destroy to remove all the created resources when no longer needed.
